# Project Overview

this project is when you upload a video to the model in streamlit web UI it predict whats the person is doing in the video is it sitting, standing, reading or walkind etc 

## What this repo includes
- Streamlit app
- ML/AI


---

### Notable components
- **Entry points detected**
- codes and output/code pre/app.py
- codes and output/code current/app.py




---

## Environment Setup

You’ll need Python 3.10+.

```bash
# 1) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) (Optional) If using Jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=project-kernel
```

If you run into platform‑specific build issues (e.g., `psycopg2`, `torch`), install the appropriate wheels for your OS/CPU/GPU.

## Quickstart

Choose what matches your use case.

### A) Run a Streamlit app 
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# or, if the entry is named differently:
streamlit run app.py
```



### C) Execute a specific script
```bash
python path/to/script.py --help
# then run with appropriate CLI arguments
```

### D) Open the notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```
Open any of the `.ipynb` files listed above and run cells top‑to‑bottom.

## Configuration

the project expects secrets or runtime settings, it typically uses one of:
- `.env` file in the repo root (for local dev)
- `config.yaml`/`settings.toml` in a `config/` folder

Common variables:
- API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- Database URLs (e.g., `POSTGRES_URI`)
- Model and data paths

**Never commit real secrets.** Use `.env.example` to document variables.

---

## Data & Artifacts

- **Data inputs**: listed under “Data files” above. If large, they may be placeholders.
- **Model artifacts**: any `.pkl`, `.pt`, `.h5`, etc. are included for reproducibility or references.

If distributions are large or proprietary, replace them with sample subsets and document the original paths.

---



## Logging & Monitoring

Typical patterns:
- Python `logging` module for structured logs
- Progress bars via `tqdm` in longer jobs
- Metrics persisted to CSV/JSON or MLflow (if configured)

---

## CI/CD (Optional)

If you add GitHub Actions:
- Lint/type‑check: `ruff`, `flake8`, `black`, `mypy`
- Test: `pytest`
- Build: Docker or Python packaging if relevant

---

## Project Walkthrough (How to read the code)

1. **Start with entry points**: codes and output/code pre/app.py, codes and output/code current/app.py
2. **Follow the data flow**: look for `data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/` modules.
3. **Check model training or business logic** inside scripts/notebooks with “train”, “fit”, “predict”, “evaluate” in their names.
4. **Review configs** to understand environment expectations.


---

## Dependencies

Dependencies were **auto‑detected** by scanning Python imports across `.py` and `.ipynb`. See `requirements.txt` for the list. If your platform needs specific versions, pin them there.
